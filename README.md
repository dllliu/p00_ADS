# Collaborative Storytelling by ADS
# Daniel Liu (PM), Sam Lubelsky (Developer), Ayman Habib (Developer)
# Description
Our site requires the user to either create an account or log in in order to access it. Upon successful login, users are able to create a story or edit an existing story. 
Upon creating, users will be able to give your story a title. When editing, users are only shown the latest update, so try to be creative! Also, after a user has edited, they cannot edit the same story again. Users can view any story they have contributed to, so the more the merrier!
