Merged my devTools branch with main.  The db_tools.py file now contains all the functions necessary for reading and writing to the sqlite database.  The database should be read and written to using solely these functions.  They seem to be fully working based on my tests.

SamuelL -- 2022-11-09 9:51
Added More to db_tools.py.  Added some routing in __init__ and created and edited some of our html templates.

Modified init.py for /create_story (functions, logic). Create works. Modified home page template so input is taken from the actual home page instead of redirecting. 

DanielL -- 2022-11-11 18:29
Improved display of elements on home page. Finished view and debugged edit. Removed test cases in data.db and replaced with existing stories. Modify story templates for wide applicability. Added return buttons to every template. Tested and found timeout of session after inactivity?

Rerouted Create Account page to new page, adding button on login/landing page to redirect to such account creation page. Changed username input for "add_story" in order to track current username rather than just the hardcoded "ads"

DanielL -- 2022-11-12 18:24
Added question mark input for some functions in db_tools. Change text=password back in templates.

Did a lot of debugging and error checking.  Tried to ensure flask never displays an error to the browser and they always go to our custom error.html page with an appropriate message to the user explaining the issue.

SamuelL -- 2022-11-14 14:45
Fixed bugs relating to sql calls not using wildcards and flask errors.
